        Hello, I'm <b><i>Abdulra'uf</i></b
        >, a student, entreprenuer and a tech enthusiast with a passion for
        <br />
        cloud computing/engineering. As an introvert who's also cool to hang out
        with, I believe <br />
        in the power of technology to transform the world. My goal in life is to
        become an expert <br />
        in cloud computing/engineering, and I aspire to work for Microsoft in
        the future. To achieve <br />
        this, I've taken the first step on my journey by joining
        <b><i>AltSchool</i></b
        >, where I'm honing my skills <br />
        and striving to become a <b><i>world-class</i></b> cloud engineer.
